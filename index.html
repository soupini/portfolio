            <h1>Changeling <span class="date">May 2023 - August 2023</span></h1>
            <h2>RIT School of Interactive Games and Media (Co-Op)</h2>
            <h3>Programmer, Designer</h3>
            <p>Changeling is a VR narrative mystery game created in Unreal Engine 4.</p>
            <p>I was designated as a Game Developer, meaning I took the role of a designer and a programmer. I was on a team of six in charge of the game's first few levels, specifically everything from the opening dream sequence to the city streets level.</p>
            <p>This was my first experience being a part of a much larger project. The project was split into two week sprints, at the end of which playtests would be held. At the beginning of each sprint, the team would discuss our goals and how we could incorporate feedback on our part of the game. While I had experience with a similar structure before, this was on a much larger scale. Thankfully, it was easy to adapt, helped in part by the team I was on.</p>
            <p>In order to stay coordinated, our team had daily stand-up meetings where we would explain what we're working on and planning on working on to both each other and a project manager. These stand-up meetings helped us stay coordinated and prevent any sort of communication errors that could hurt development. Even beyond these meetings, our team was very communicative with each other. We would always let each other know about development problems we were facing, problems we needed help solving, and other essential information that could otherwise fly under the radar. One of my primary takeaways from the co-op was that being on a responsive team is essential to making development go smoothly.</p>

            <h1>Ash the Scavenger <span class="date">May 2024 - Present</span></h1>
            <h2>Solo Project (Work in Progress)</h2>
            <p>Ash the Scavenger is a 2D explorative action platformer made with C# and the Godot game engine. You play as an outlaw robot named Ash who steals energy from a corrupt corporation in order to give it to those in need.</p>
            <p>This project is currently in an early prototyping phase. My current goal is to nail down the game's base mechanics and make movement as smooth as possible. In addition, I created a working design document, began experimenting with the game's artstyle, and created various sketches detailing specific gameplay elements, ranging from movement mechanics to level hazards.</p>

            <h1>SCRAP <span class="date">March 2024 - Present</span></h1>
            <h2>Solo Project (Work in Progress)</h2>
            <p>SCRAP is a top-down shooter metroidvania made with C# and the Godot game engine. An alien empire has conquered Earth by turning humanity's technology against itself. It's now your job to free the planet by searching for various gadgets and weapons to combat their army of re-engineered household appliances.</p>
            <p>Much like Ash the Scavenger, this project is in an early prototyping phase. The goal for this prototype is to create a minimum viable experience that represents both the game's basic combat and the core gameplay loop of exploring, finding upgrades, and using said upgrades to open up the world and progress through the game. The game has a working design document, a handful of completed assets, and various sketches detailing gameplay elements such as enemy AI.</p>

            <h2>Solo Project</h2>
            <p>SKELETON!!! is a 2D arcade-styled platformer programmed with JavaScript and the PixiJS library. In this game, you play as a skeleton defending themself from home-invading exorcists.</p>
            <p>This project was made within two weeks. It was the first game I've made on my own where I had to reach a hard deadline. I had to properly scope the game to make sure I could complete it within the two week window, as well as schedule my work on the game and prioritize essential features. I began with the most basic and hard to program features, before gradually working on the smaller, less essential features.</p>

            <h3>Artist, Programmer</h3>
            <p>Friendly Fire is a bullet hell programmed with C# and the MonoGame framework. You play as a knight without a weapon, trying to escape a dungeon by making enemies hit each other with their own projectiles.</p>
            <p>I was in charge of character design and in-game art. With the exception of the title screen, pause and game over graphics, and the skeleton sprites, I made all of the in-game graphics. In addition, I programmed the animation for the player character and enemies.</p>
            <p>This is a group project where I and four other people were tasked with making a game throughout an entire semester. We had to reach multiple deadlines throughout the semester all while preparing presentations and maintaining a documentation page. In addition to working on the parts of the game I was in charge of, I communicated with my teammates as much as possible through in-person meetings and group DMs through Discord. I made sure to talk about what I was working on, comment all of my code to make it understandable, and talk to other teammates to better understand their code and tasks.</p>
