            <h1>SKELETON!!!</h1>
            <h2>Solo College Project</h2>
            <p>SKELETON!!! is a 2D arcade-styled platformer programmed with JavaScript and the PixiJS library. In this game, you play as a skeleton defending themself from home-invading exorcists.</p>
            <p>This project was made within two weeks. It was the first game I've made on my own where I had to reach a hard deadline. I had to properly scope the game to make sure I could complete it within the two week window, as well as schedule my work on the game and prioritize essential features. I began with the most basic and hard to program features, before gradually working on the smaller, less essential features.</p>

            <h1>Friendly Fire</h1>
            <h2>Collaborative College Project</h2>
            <p>Friendly Fire is a bullet hell programmed with C# and the MonoGame framework. You play as a knight without a weapon, trying to escape a dungeon by making enemies hit each other with their own projectiles.</p>
            <p>I was in charge of character design and in-game art. With the exception of the title screen, pause and game over graphics, and the skeleton sprites, I made all of the in-game graphics. In addition, I worked on animation implementation. Specifically, I programmed the animation for the player character and enemies.</p>
            <p>This is a group project where I and four other people were tasked with making a game throughout an entire semester. We had to reach multiple deadlines throughout the semester all while preparing presentations and maintaining a documentation page. In addition to working on the parts of the game I was in charge of, I communicated with my teammates as much as possible through in-person meetings and group DMs through Discord. I made sure to talk about what I was working on, comment all of my code to make it understandable, and talk to other teammates to better understand their code and tasks.</p>
